# TryPy
Learn Python the best way - *by doing*

## Overview
TryPy is meant to be both a resource for learning Python and an opprotunity to contribute to a culture of programming knowledge. 
In this package you will find tutorials for understanding basic Python syntax, using third party modules in your code, and how
to write reusable Python code. Additionally, visitors are encouraged to contribute an example of their favorite module implementation
to encourage other site users with the hope of sharing the various technology available for use with Python.

## Installation
In order to take advantage of this codebase, it stands to reason you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can find the link to download [Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For the purposes of the tutorial, we'll be working with Python 2.7.x; consult the specific demo package for the Python version to use.

To test whether or not you have Python installed, you can enter the command `python --version` to print the version of Python pointed to by your interpreter. If you want to take advantage of the sandbox Python offers through its shell, simply enter `python` in the terminal to open a Python shell. In here you can enter in single Python command, or string together conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. 

## Running a Python Program
To run a Python script in its simplest form, enter the command `python /path/to/script`. For example, if there is a script named hello.py in our current directory, entering `python hello.py` will run the hello.py script/
